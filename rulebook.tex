\section{Introduction}

	In the words of Fantasy Flight Games:
	\begin{quotation}
		``\emph{Android:Netrunner} is a two-player Living Card Game set in a dystopian, cyberpunk future where monolithic megacorps own and control the vast majority of human interests.

		While corporation players try to score points by advancing their agendas, they have to guard their intellectual properties from the elite and subversive hackers known as netrunners.''
	\end{quotation}

While \emph{A:NR} is a fantastic game with exceptional thematic flavor, it doesn't quite capture the classic heist trappings of the cyberpunk genre it is lifted from. \emph{//wintermute} seeks to remedy this by appending rules for more than two players in addition to expanding story-telling mechanics. Three runners will face off against a single corporation, each assuming a specialized role on a team bent on disrupting the corp's plans. The corporation will be trying to fend off the runner team as it executes a multi-step secret plan, trying to distract and hoodwink the runners before the objectives are revealed.

	\emph{//wintermute} is intended to be a freely distributed fan expansion that can be modified and enhanced by \emph{A:NR} fans anywhere. By default \emph{//wintermute} will include this rulebook, 3-5 play scenarios (though more should be coming all the time!), and a small amount of printable play materials for the base game and each scenario. 

\section{New Rules and Differences}

While the bulk of rules for \emph{//wintermute} are the same as those for vanilla \emph{A:NR}, there are several important differences, namely in deckbuilding and the default action structure for both sides. 
\subsection{Runners}

The most obvious difference from the base game is that multiple runners will be working as a team to take down the corporation, unlike the base game where players face off one on one. Like any good piece of heist fiction, the ``thieves`` all have their own specialization to contribute to the team. In this case, those specialties are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{The Coder}-
		This runner spends more time at a terminal than anywhere else, writing and installing software ranging from icebreakers to viruses to utility programs. The player taking the role of \textbf{Coder} is the only runner allowed to include \textbf{Program} cards in their deck. This makes them a natural fit for being the team's lead on actual runs against the corporation, but time spent running is time spent not developing. Finding ways to get crucial software into the hands of the other runners will be a key skill for a good \textbf{Coder}.
	\item \textbf{The Techie}-
		Software may be the key piece that enables the art of running, but all software needs metal to do the actual computation. The \textbf{Techie} is the team's \textbf{Hardware} specialist and keeps operations running smoothly. She can get the best deals on off-the-shelf components and knows exactly how to resurrect a \textbf{Console} that had been left for dead. The \textbf{Techie} is the only runner allowed to have \textbf{Hardware} in their deck.
	\item \textbf{The Face}-
		The other members might be more comfortable at a keyboard or a workbench, but the \textbf{Face} is in his element pounding pavement, looking for \textbf{Resources} out in meatspace that the team can use. When cash, names, or favors need to change hands the \textbf{Face} knows just the guy to take care of it. The other runners may not include \textbf{Resources} in their decks, making the \textbf{Face} a necessity for those tricky handshake transactions.
\end{itemize}
\section{Materials}
This is where the needed materials will go. This will mostly be print and play stuff, with requirements for some netrunner cards.
