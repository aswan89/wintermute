# wintermute
A multiplayer variant of Android:Netrunner by Fantasy Flight Games.

wintermute is designed to make A:NR a more story-driven experience, pitting 3 runners against a single corporation. Each runner specializes in a single aspect of the less-than-legal world of hacking, attempting to disrupt the well-laid plans of a mega-corporation by any means necessary. On the other side, corporations are trying to execute a highly specialized plan, ranging from pre-ordained disaster relief to complete media control.
